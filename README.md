# groupable

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/agilogy/groupable.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/agilogy/groupable)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/agilogy/groupable/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/agilogy/groupable)

A group method on TraversableOnce (and subclasses) that relies on the element order and preserves it.

```
import com.agilogy.utils.Groupable._
val people: Seq[Person] = ???
val peopleByName:Seq[(Name,Seq[Person])] = people.group(by = _.name)
```

It behaves somewhat like the standard groupBy but:
- It relies on the order of the traversable creating a group for each consecutive element that returns the same group key
- It preserves the order of the returned groups
- It returns a Seq of pairs key -> Seq(value) instead of a Map. 
  - I could have used a ListMap, but the seq makes it evident that lookup time is linear.

The method is added to TraversableOnce and subclasses via [Pimp my Library Pattern](http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=179766).

## Installation

```
resolvers += Resolver.url("Agilogy Scala",url("http://dl.bintray.com/agilogy/scala/"))(Resolver.ivyStylePatterns)

libraryDependencies += "com.agilogy" %% "groupable" % "1.0.0"
```

## Usage

Import Groupable._:

```
import com.agilogy.utils.Groupable._
```

Now, a new method `group` is available on TraversableOnce[T]:

```
def group[GT, RT](by: (T) ⇒ GT, as: (T) ⇒ RT = identity[T]): Seq[(GT, Seq[RT])]
```

Example (from the tests):

```
it should "group mapping values" in {
  val s = Seq("email" -> "j@example.com", "email" -> "k@example.com", "name" -> "John")
  val res = s.group(by = _._1, as = _._2)
  assert(res === Seq("email" -> Seq("j@example.com", "k@example.com"), "name" -> Seq("John")))
}
```

## Roadmap

- Maybe we could use a typeclass so that not only `TraversableOne`s are groupables. As an example, it could be interesting for `ResultSet`s.
